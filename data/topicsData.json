      "Hindi movie Andhadhun, starring Ayushman Khuranna, Radhika Apte and Tabu was a super duper hit in 2018. It was universally appreciated and ended up being the one of the highest grossers of the year.",
      "Now actor Prashanth, the 90's heartthrob was missing from the full-on action for quite sometime now. He was last seen in 'Johnny' in 2018. He was also a part for actor Ram Charan's 'Vinaya Vidheya Rama'.Both the movies didn't help a notch in Prashanth's career.",
      "Now, Prashanth is playing the lead role in Andhadhun's Tamil remake, named 'Andhagan'. Now this is a terrific piece of news for all Prashanth's fans, who are eagerly waiting to see him back in form.",
      "The other actors include Karthick and Simran. The music is by Santhosh Narayanan. It is being bankrolled by the actor's father Thiagarajan. The movie is to be directed by Fredrick, who last directed Jothika's 'Pon Magal vandhal'.",
      "Now this is a sensational setting for actor Prashanth to prove himself to today's audience. A solid, proven script, a young and energetic team, along with the right timing. He was a crowd puller and ruled the Tamil cinema during the 90's. Now it is time for him to turn the clock back.",
      "Prior to this announcement, director Jayam Raja was in talks to helm the movie. Due to difference of opinion, he left the project. Let's hope this movie works big time for actor Prashanth. Stay tuned to Cinema Period."

      "Nearly 100 Tamil movies are waiting for the right time to get a proper theatrical release. Even though the theatres were permitted to open for the audience with 50% occupancy, the response for the movie goers has been lukewarm. This can be due to few reasons like people are still wary of the virus infection, lack of solid movies that deserve a theatre visits, availability of OTT playforms and web series to view from the cosy sofas, etc.",
      "Now that the virus infection rate has come down further, the movie industry is waiting to use  upcoming Pongal season to bounce back, with few solid releases. The movie industry had requested the TN Govt to allow 100% occupancy at the theatres. The TN Govt has finally conceded and has passed a Government Order for the same.",
      "Following the Government Order, the industry folks have been thanking TN Chief Minister for the same.Director Bharathi Raja has issued a press release thanking the TN Government for hearing out the industry's voice.",
      "Two movies 'Master' and 'Eeswaran' are getting released on Jan 13th and Jan 14h, 2021. Master was supposedly to be released on April 9th, 2020. Interestingly, Eeswaran was planned and completed during the lockdown itself. Both actors 'Vijay' and 'Simbu' are known as crowd pullers and the theatres are being readied to welcome the crowds.",
      "The whistles, claps and celebrations might see the light of the day again after 9 months. Though the virus threat is not completely out of sight, the people are trying to shrug off those factors and hope for the best. Watch this space for more news and reviews."

      "Actor Vijay Sethupathi is one actor in Indian Cinema who is constantly juggling different things, so much so that he has a lineup that is unmatched. He is a part of 1 hour web film called 'Mugizh', plays antagonist in Vijay's 'Master', producing movies, acting in extended cameos, making debuts in other languages as well. The ace actor is now making his debut in Hindi Cinema with 'Mumbaikar' movie.",
      "Earlier, he was reported to make his debut with Aamir Khan's Laal Singh Chaddha, but he has opted out from that movie.",
      "This movie is a official remake of Lokash Kanagaraj's 'Maanagaram' movie. It is to be directed and picturized by Santhosh Sivan, with Vikrant Massey as the lead actor. No, what? Vijay Sethupathi is not playing the lead in his debut Hindi movie? Yes, he is known to suprise us. Vikram Massey is reprising the role actually played by actor Sudhip Kishan in Managaram.",
      "So, what is the role for Vijay Sethupathi? It was originally played by actor Munishkaanth. It is a very interesting and heavily comic oriented role, and with Vijay Sethupathi enacting it, he would add his style in it.",
      "The movie's poster was released by the 'Bahubali' director SS Rajamouli and director Karan Johar on Twitter.",
      "The movie is produced by Shibhu Tameens. The music is by Prashant Pillai. The movie cast includes Sanjay Mishra, Sachin Khedekar and Tanay Maniktala. Keep an eye on Cienema Period space for more updates."

      "As per the teaser, we can definitely say that Vijay Antony has come a look way as an actor. An actor who has accepted and worked within his comfort zone, is trying to break from it by getting used as a action hero. The teaser stamps few dance grooves and romatic scenes as well. The actor surely seems to be working on improving his performances to be future-proof in the industry.",
      "Vijay Antony was last seen in Kolaigaran movie that was well received by the audience. The movie is bankrolled by Chendur Film International. It is a first for Vijay Antony-Aathmikha pair also. Apart from this movie, Vijay Antony has a slew of movies in making including Thamezharasan, Agni Siragugal, Khaki and Pichaikaran 2.

The event was also live streamed on Youtube.",

      "With his belligerent looks and glow, actor Simbu's speech was the obvious highlight of the event. He pins hopes on this movie to bring positivity among the audience, during this torrid time of Corona. Apparently, the producer Mr.Balaji has been finalized just a couple of weeks before the shooting commencement, and rightfully the producer was praised for his confidence in the team. With much spiritualism and sans punch dialogue and self praise, a Simbu's speech was motivational and spoken right from the heart.",
      "Actor Bharathiraja heaped praise on Simbu's discipline and gentle nature. And ofcourse the Tamizhan bonding among them.",
      "The cinematography is by Tirru and editing work by Anthony. The festival Pongal is known for a long leave and elaborate celebrations. With Master and Eeswaran, the audience are in for a grand treat.",
      "With the entire team hoping for a 100% occupancy regulations from the TN government, the order is still pending. Some say that the Government might allow for 75% occupancy, further adding to the confusion and anxiety.",
      "Another movie with Simbu-Suseenthiran project to be released for Diwali 2021 is also in cards. Hopefully, this movie's success must pave way for the movie in talks.",
      "With the Corona cases on the decline, the decision from TN Govt is highly anticipated one. Stay tuned to this space for more updates."

      "The existential coolie in me is happy because I now carry the burden of my past. The innocent Gujarati child in 1995 – who forced his mother to make spicy bhel puri after his cravings were triggered by Govinda and Karishma Kapoor finding amorous metaphors in Mumbai street-food – had absolutely no idea that 25 years later he’d be waking up on Christmas morning of the darkest year in modern history to review Coolie No. 1, lose his appetite and wonder how Santa Claus eats sev-puri without soiling that glorious beard. This is the cruellest form of time-travel: Everything has changed and nothing has changed. While it’s mighty philanthropic of director David Dhawan to make us forget that the year is 2020, it’s also misanthropic to make us forget that the human mind has evolved in the last 25 years. Between Judwaa 2 and this one, it’s hard to imagine a less productive way of making movies.",

We want justice for SSR but not by boycotting Alia,Varun,Sara  etc.I have been waiting for this movie for like nearly 2yr..This movie is gonna be a hit...most people r gonna avoid a hard work of VD and many more just because he is a star kid..what happnd if he is a star kid..he came up with his own hard work..There r billions of fan not just in FB Insta and twittr there r many more Varuniacs..And I am sure Varuniacs will support VD no mattr what othrs think..Varun is really humble and very kind and fun person..he really behavs humbly towards the fans.as many actors behave not politeley to the fans..I am 100%sure Varuniacs are not just fan of his movies dancing etc. His personality really is very good and He is very HARD WORKING..He is one of the most hard working Actors I have evr known.."

After completing the shooting in record time (less than 30 days), Simbu has been mightily impressed by the movie's director Suseenthiran's working style and skills. So much so that he is in talks to do another movie with the same director",
      "This is one of the rare instances where a Simbu movie has been completed without any problems. Simbu has been the target of many people, both in the industry and from the general people, due to his conflicting behaviour on the sets and his constant attitude and delays in completing the promised movies.",
      "As for everybody, it was indeed Simbu's downtime. Now, he is soaring back. With his chisiled looks back, he is more involved in honouring his commitments. His support in completing his Eeswaran and Maanadu has been quite impressive, even for established industry folks. Along with actor Vijay's Master, Eeswaran is expected to release for this Pongal. One might say, it is a long overdue for Simbu's fans."
